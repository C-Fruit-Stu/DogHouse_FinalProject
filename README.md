## 🧠 Overview

DogHouse is designed to help dog trainers and their customers interact through a unified system with role-based functionality:

- A **mobile application** where customers can:
  - Discover trainers by location and rating
  - Make payments
  - Track income and status (for trainer accounts)
  - View trainer-managed posts and updates (visible only to customers associated with that trainer)

- A **web dashboard** accessible by trainers and admins, enabling:
  - Easier content and data management
  - Administrative functions via desktop

The application also integrates **Gemini AI** to assist with animal-related questions, providing intelligent, context-aware answers for users within the app.
